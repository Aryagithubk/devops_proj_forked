# DevOps Tools Explained - Quick Reference

## Tool Roles & Responsibilities

### 1. Terraform 🏗️
**Role:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**What it does:**
- Creates AWS resources (EC2, VPC, Security Groups)
- Provisions the "foundation" for your application
- Manages infrastructure lifecycle

**In this project:**
- Creates 3 EC2 instances (Backend, Frontend, Nagios)
- Sets up VPC and networking
- Configures security groups (firewalls)
- Manages infrastructure state

**Key commands:**
```bash
terraform init    # Initialize
terraform plan    # Preview changes
terraform apply   # Create resources
terraform destroy # Delete everything
```

**Analogy:** Terraform is like a construction company that builds the buildings (servers) and roads (networks).

### 2. Ansible ⚙️
**Role:** Configuration Management & Deployment

**What it does:**
- Configures servers after they're created
- Deploys applications
- Installs software packages
- Executes tasks on remote servers

**In this project:**
- Installs Node.js on servers
- Copies application code
- Installs dependencies (npm install)
- Configures services (systemd)
- Sets up Nginx for frontend

**Key commands:**
```bash
ansible all -m ping                    # Test connectivity
ansible-playbook playbook.yml          # Run playbook
ansible all -m shell -a "uptime"       # Run ad-hoc command
```

**Analogy:** Ansible is like an interior designer that furnishes the buildings and makes them functional.

---

### 3. Puppet 🎭
**Role:** Configuration Management (State Enforcement)

**What it does:**
- Ensures servers stay in desired state
- Continuously manages configuration
- Auto-corrects drift from desired state
- Complements Ansible

**In this project:**
- Ensures services are always running
- Manages firewall rules
- Keeps packages up to date
- Auto-restarts failed services

**Key commands:**
```bash
puppet apply manifest.pp        # Apply configuration
puppet apply --noop manifest.pp # Dry run
puppet parser validate file.pp  # Check syntax
```

**Analogy:** Puppet is like a maintenance crew that ensures everything stays as designed and fixes problems automatically.

---

### 4. Nagios 📊
**Role:** Monitoring & Alerting

**What it does:**
- Monitors server health
- Checks service availability
- Tracks resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- Sends alerts when problems occur

**In this project:**
- Monitors backend server (API health, SSH)
- Monitors frontend server (HTTP, SSH)
- Checks ping/connectivity
- Provides web dashboard for visualization

**Key features:**
- Real-time status monitoring
- Service checks every 5 minutes
- Historical data
- Web-based interface

**Analogy:** Nagios is like a security guard that watches everything 24/7 and alerts you when something goes wrong.

## How They Work Together

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Deployment Flow                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. TERRAFORM (Infrastructure)
   ├─ Creates AWS infrastructure
   ├─ Sets up networking
   └─ Provisions 3 EC2 instances
   
2. ANSIBLE (Deployment)
   ├─ Waits for servers to be ready
   ├─ Deploys backend application
   ├─ Deploys frontend application
   └─ Sets up Nagios monitoring
   
3. PUPPET (Configuration Management)
   ├─ Applies to all servers
   ├─ Ensures services are running
   └─ Maintains desired state continuously
   
4. NAGIOS (Monitoring)
   ├─ Monitors all servers
   ├─ Checks service health
   └─ Provides visibility
```

## Comparison Table

| Tool | Type | When it Runs | Primary Purpose |
|------|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Terraform** | Declarative | On-demand (manual) | Create infrastructure |
| **Ansible** | Imperative | On-demand (manual) | Deploy & configure |
| **Puppet** | Declarative | Continuous (scheduled) | Maintain state |
| **Nagios** | Monitoring | Continuous (always) | Monitor & alert |

## When to Use What?

### Use Terraform when:
- Creating new infrastructure
- Modifying infrastructure
- Destroying resources
- Managing cloud resources

### Use Ansible when:
- Deploying applications
- Installing software
- One-time configuration tasks
- Running commands on multiple servers

### Use Puppet when:
- Ensuring services stay running
- Managing long-term configuration
- Enforcing security policies
- Preventing configuration drift

### Use Nagios when:
- Need visibility into system health
- Want to be alerted of problems
- Need historical performance data
- Troubleshooting issues

## Real-World Workflow

**Initial Deployment:**
1. Terraform → Create infrastructure
2. Ansible → Deploy applications
3. Puppet → Configure management
4. Nagios → Start monitoring

**Daily Operations:**
- Nagios → Continuously monitors
- Puppet → Runs every 30 minutes (keeps things correct)

**Making Changes:**
- Code changes → Use Ansible to redeploy
- Infrastructure changes → Use Terraform
- Configuration changes → Update Puppet manifests

**Problem Occurs:**
1. Nagios detects it (alerts you)
2. Puppet tries to auto-fix (restarts service)
3. If needed, Ansible deploys fixes
4. Last resort, Terraform recreates infrastructure

## Why Use All Four?

**Each tool has strengths:**

- **Terraform** is best at infrastructure
- **Ansible** is best at deployment
- **Puppet** is best at maintaining state
- **Nagios** is best at monitoring

**Together they provide:**
- ✅ Complete automation
- ✅ Infrastructure as code
- ✅ Self-healing systems
- ✅ Full visibility
- ✅ Disaster recovery
- ✅ Audit trail

---

## Can You Use Just One?

**Technically yes, but:**

- Terraform alone → No app deployment
- Ansible alone → Manual infrastructure, no monitoring
- Puppet alone → No initial setup
- Nagios alone → Only monitoring, no management

**Best practice:** Use the right tool for each job!

## Learning Path

1. **Week 1:** Understand each tool individually
2. **Week 2:** Use them together in this project
3. **Week 3:** Experiment with changes
4. **Week 4:** Break things and fix them

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Terraform** = Infrastructure (the "what")  
✅ **Ansible** = Deployment (the "how")  
✅ **Puppet** = Maintenance (the "ensure")  
✅ **Nagios** = Monitoring (the "watch")  

Together = **Complete DevOps Solution** 🎉
